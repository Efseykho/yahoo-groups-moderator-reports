yahoo-groups-moderator-reports
==============================

Yahoo Groups moderator tools are woefully nonexistant! This is unfortunate for those of us stuck moderating them.

So at one point (mainly, now) I got stuck being the approval authority for a particular Yahoo Group. Turns out Yahoo really doesn't provide any feedback or info about moderation statistics.

Things I wanted to know:
* who's actively moderating
* how many messages were approved
* time of approval and time to approval

So I put this collection of scripts together.

Required packages:
* gmail
* tzinfo
* yaml
* gruff (for pretty graphics only, otherwise you get sad, ugly yaml)
